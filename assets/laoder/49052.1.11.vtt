00:02.460 --> 00:04.520
You all need to stop this nonsense.

00:05.510 --> 00:08.240
Today is the first official 
game for the B team,

00:08.240 --> 00:10.280
the opening of the Tokyo Metropolis League.

00:10.280 --> 00:15.280
Man, your behavior this past week 
is bringing down the team's morale.

00:15.730 --> 00:19.370
Honestly, your opponent is not that strong.

00:19.370 --> 00:22.870
Aoi

00:19.370 --> 00:22.870
Fujimiya

00:19.370 --> 00:22.870
Tachibana

00:19.370 --> 00:22.870
Kuroda

00:19.370 --> 00:22.870
Taira

00:19.370 --> 00:22.870
Ohtomo

00:19.370 --> 00:22.870
Asari

00:19.370 --> 00:22.870
Nagano

00:19.370 --> 00:22.870
Isshiki

00:19.370 --> 00:22.870
Takeshima

00:19.370 --> 00:22.870
Nikaido

00:19.370 --> 00:22.870
Sub
Shima
Myojin  Saito
Togashi Kuwata
Numazu Roan

00:19.370 --> 00:24.350
But at this rate, we might 
very well let a win go. Man...

01:57.820 --> 02:04.080
<b>Tokyo Metropolis League Match 1 - Seikyo High School</b>

01:58.620 --> 02:02.080
Ever since that incident, 
the animosity between us and Asari

02:02.080 --> 02:04.560
sort of spread through the 
rest of the first-years...

02:04.790 --> 02:06.940
But talk about Asari!

02:06.940 --> 02:11.440
Man, he is so unhappy that Ashito 
was chosen to be a starter.

02:11.750 --> 02:13.530
Because you stole their spot...

02:14.450 --> 02:18.550
I just can't let go of what he said!

02:19.030 --> 02:20.320
I feel the same way.

02:20.890 --> 02:24.830
But can we play a match feeling like this?

02:25.630 --> 02:30.010
Why were Kuroda and Asari mad at you?

02:30.760 --> 02:32.590
Find the answer to that.

02:33.310 --> 02:35.490
If you can't do that,

02:36.170 --> 02:39.590
I won't field you in a match 
for the next three months.

02:40.810 --> 02:43.620
<i>I haven't solved anything yet.</i>

02:44.330 --> 02:47.640
<i>But all I can do now is play!</i>

02:47.640 --> 02:51.940
Jeez, I told you I'd come home.

02:51.940 --> 02:55.140
When? Of course when I have time to do it.

02:55.140 --> 02:57.430
You don't know when to stop, do you?

02:57.430 --> 02:59.060
Are you my mother?

02:59.060 --> 03:01.490
Old man! I mean, Manager Fukuda.

03:01.840 --> 03:03.860
Oh, what's up, Ashito?

03:03.860 --> 03:05.870
Is that Hana on the phone?

03:06.290 --> 03:07.970
Yeah. It's Hana.

03:08.940 --> 03:12.150
Wait, are you and Hana close or something?

03:12.980 --> 03:15.290
Can you hold up your receiver for me to talk?

03:15.290 --> 03:19.130
"Receiver"? Oh, like this?

03:19.130 --> 03:22.640
Hey, I'm following your mean plan.

03:22.640 --> 03:25.140
<b>Hana</b>

03:24.040 --> 03:26.690
And... I'm off to play in a match!

03:26.690 --> 03:29.310
As a starter right off the bat! 
My official debut!

03:29.310 --> 03:32.170
As expected from the reincarnation 
of Ferenc PuskÃ¡s!

03:32.170 --> 03:33.650
My caliber is extraordinary!

03:33.650 --> 03:35.900
<b>Hana</b>

03:36.570 --> 03:39.210
You may come cheer for me.

03:39.620 --> 03:40.530
That is all!

03:47.540 --> 03:48.440
Ashito.

03:49.820 --> 03:51.340
How are you feeling today?

03:51.340 --> 03:52.410
Think you can win?

03:54.460 --> 03:57.690
I've never had to think so 
much about a game before.

03:58.420 --> 03:59.650
But we'll win!

04:00.040 --> 04:01.100
How?

04:02.890 --> 04:04.180
I'll score goals.

04:05.450 --> 04:08.220
I'm going to say something obvious here.

04:09.400 --> 04:11.800
In soccer, you can't do anything by yourself.

04:12.470 --> 04:14.190
More so than you think.

04:15.990 --> 04:19.940
And that's exactly why it's so fun to play.

04:22.570 --> 04:26.320
<b>Main Ground   Today's Schedule</b>

04:22.570 --> 04:26.320
<b>Youth B</b>

04:22.570 --> 04:26.320
<b>Seikyo High School</b>

04:22.570 --> 04:26.320
<b>Information</b>

04:22.570 --> 04:26.320
<b>Tokyo Metropolitan League, Match 1</b>

04:23.260 --> 04:27.630
Hmm, Esperion Youth B...

04:27.630 --> 04:29.580
Team B?

04:29.580 --> 04:31.370
Jeez, a <i>second</i> team?!

04:31.370 --> 04:33.650
Oh man, what do I do?!

04:33.650 --> 04:37.180
I was told to photograph 
the future Japanese National Team!

04:37.180 --> 04:39.340
Sekiya-san is going to have my hide...

04:39.340 --> 04:43.080
Seikyo! Let's go, Seikyo!

04:41.710 --> 04:44.720
Oh, I'm on the opponent's side...

04:43.080 --> 04:57.510


04:45.030 --> 04:47.390
Unlike a flashy cheer for a high school team,

04:47.390 --> 04:50.440
the youth team doesn't have much of 
a following, so they're easy to spot.

04:50.780 --> 04:51.970
The youth team is...

04:53.080 --> 04:54.230
Yup, there they are.

04:56.260 --> 04:59.530
By the way, is what you said earlier true?

04:59.530 --> 05:02.070
Are there good players in the second team?

05:02.070 --> 05:04.240
Do you know a lot about Esperion?

05:05.730 --> 05:07.510
Hey, you...

05:07.510 --> 05:10.550
You're very cute and kind, but...

05:11.290 --> 05:13.410
Your face looks super scary.

05:13.410 --> 05:16.750
Despite being the B team, 
aren't they supposed to be elite players?

05:16.750 --> 05:18.200
They're not that great.

05:18.200 --> 05:20.830
What a disappointment, huh?

05:25.510 --> 05:27.890
<i>Why did you cut in, Takeshima?!</i>

05:27.890 --> 05:30.010
<i>I wanted to pass it to the front!</i>

05:31.490 --> 05:33.520
<i>No one's coming to follow up?!</i>

05:35.610 --> 05:37.020
Left side! Watch out!

05:43.960 --> 05:45.780
Why did you all shy away?!

05:47.910 --> 05:49.780
Nice goal!

05:50.220 --> 05:51.280
You idiots!

05:59.510 --> 06:03.490
Thirty-five minutes into the first half,
 the score's zero to three...

06:06.170 --> 06:08.430
Absolutely pathetic!

06:08.760 --> 06:13.930
We may be the B team, but we're 
still wearing Esperion uniforms!

06:13.930 --> 06:15.560
We're doing what we're supposed to.

06:18.200 --> 06:23.850
So tell me, Asari. 
By "we," who exactly are you referring to?

06:24.940 --> 06:27.210
We're all out of sync today!

06:27.210 --> 06:30.880
Are you trying to blame everything 
on us, the tryouts players?!

06:30.880 --> 06:32.010
No, I'm not!

06:32.010 --> 06:32.910
Stop it!

06:33.910 --> 06:36.220
I'm so disappointed in all of you.

06:36.840 --> 06:40.110
You carried the bad air you had in 
the practice right into the game.

06:40.110 --> 06:43.750
You made careless errors 
and gave up three goals.

06:44.250 --> 06:46.590
The problem isn't even your soccer, brats!

06:47.130 --> 06:49.710
Aren't you here to become 
professional players?

06:49.710 --> 06:52.930
Right now, you don't have an 
shred of professionalism in you!

06:54.110 --> 06:55.610
<i>My assignment...</i>

06:55.610 --> 06:57.850
<i>I still have no idea!</i>

06:58.170 --> 07:00.100
<i>In the first half, I tried 
to be on the defensive,</i>

07:00.100 --> 07:01.640
<i>which was fricking uncomfortable 
and fricking boring.</i>

07:01.640 --> 07:04.610
<i>I also tried less dribbling and 
more passing to the others,</i>

07:04.610 --> 07:05.610
<i>even though it was fricking boring.</i>

07:06.370 --> 07:10.860
<i>I did my share of boring stuff
 anyone could have done.</i>

07:11.970 --> 07:15.060
<i>Man, I'm amazed at my skills 
to do anything and everything!</i>

07:15.060 --> 07:16.680
<i>After all, I'm a genius!</i>

07:18.920 --> 07:20.870
<i>But I don't get it!</i>

07:20.870 --> 07:24.580
<i>What Asari and Kuroda want 
isn't anything like that.</i>

07:24.580 --> 07:29.130
<i>Because they still won't even
 look in my direction.</i>

07:29.130 --> 07:31.460
<i>Look at me!</i>

07:31.460 --> 07:33.310
<i>Don't you get it?!</i>

07:33.310 --> 07:38.640
<i>If we don't work together, 
we'll end up losing!</i>

07:39.320 --> 07:43.900
Coach Nozomi, please switch them out with
 some of the second and third-years.

07:45.460 --> 07:47.260
We can't make a play like this.

07:47.610 --> 07:53.910
In particular, Aoi, Kuroda, and Asari on the 
left line are not functioning at all.

07:56.100 --> 07:58.690
I fully realize I am overstepping here,

07:59.070 --> 08:01.460
but I don't want to lose!

08:01.860 --> 08:02.920
Very well.

08:02.920 --> 08:03.920
<i>Wait...</i>

08:04.490 --> 08:06.790
If you can't complete the assignment...

08:07.530 --> 08:08.050
<i>Hold on...</i>

08:08.340 --> 08:13.050
Togashi, go in for Isshiki at 
center back for the second half.

08:13.050 --> 08:13.800


08:14.550 --> 08:16.760
Wh-What are you saying?!

08:16.760 --> 08:20.350
When things are already messy as is, 
you plan to add Togashi in the mix?

08:20.350 --> 08:22.430
I'm not so sure about it myself.

08:22.670 --> 08:26.440
I don't feel I can go and score three goals
 with these promoted players.

08:28.140 --> 08:30.970
They're more interested in 
protecting their elite status

08:30.970 --> 08:34.300
and cheap sense of pride 
over winning the game.

08:35.010 --> 08:39.330
Those who grew up in the academy 
haven't changed much.

08:39.550 --> 08:40.830
You bastard!

08:40.830 --> 08:42.080
Say it one more time!

08:42.080 --> 08:43.330
Togashi!

08:45.330 --> 08:47.330
That's not true.

08:48.580 --> 08:49.840
Come again?

08:49.840 --> 08:52.090
It's true that we're not in sync.

08:52.890 --> 08:54.840
We aren't communicating.

08:55.430 --> 08:58.470
But somehow, I know this to be true:

08:59.370 --> 09:01.250
Everyone's doing the best they can.

09:02.680 --> 09:04.850
None of us here is stupid enough 
to think there's anything

09:04.850 --> 09:06.590
more important than winning.

09:06.930 --> 09:09.480
At least we have that in common.

09:13.870 --> 09:15.290
Clean up whatever is festering.

09:17.490 --> 09:19.790
I won't give you any more matches.

09:19.790 --> 09:21.470
So use this one.

09:22.020 --> 09:26.550
In the 45 minutes of the second half, 
throw yourselves at each other.

09:26.550 --> 09:30.310
It may cause a chemical reaction, 
or you may self-destruct.

09:31.130 --> 09:33.350
If you do, then that's all you really had.

09:34.650 --> 09:36.870
You can go and do training runs until summer.

09:46.630 --> 09:47.690
Thanks.

09:52.470 --> 09:54.780
A-Are you serious?!

09:55.090 --> 09:59.030
The defenders are four, 
five... six at the back?!

09:59.500 --> 10:02.130
The half-backs are mostly 
positioned as defenders, as well.

10:02.130 --> 10:04.540
Who knew they'd dare to fall back that much?

10:05.400 --> 10:07.790
They're focusing on the defensive, 
without regard to appearances.

10:07.790 --> 10:10.080
That's right! All you gotta do is win!

10:10.080 --> 10:13.300
You got this! You can beat the youth team!

10:14.730 --> 10:16.630
Aoi, Kuroda, Asari!

10:17.450 --> 10:18.940
You'd better know what you're doing.

10:19.480 --> 10:21.460
Work it out as soon as possible.

10:21.460 --> 10:25.430
The line you three are creating 
is utterly useless right now.

10:26.890 --> 10:30.180
<i>The line we three are creating?</i>

10:30.810 --> 10:33.690
Why did only those two get mad?

10:34.090 --> 10:36.690
<i>Now that I think about it, back then...</i>

10:37.770 --> 10:44.080
<i>The thing that only the three of us shared,
 not the other players...</i>

10:44.740 --> 10:46.080
<i>We were on the same line.</i>

10:47.870 --> 10:50.580
<i>What is this feeling?</i>

10:51.720 --> 10:53.950
<i>Something is about to connect.</i>

10:55.010 --> 10:56.150
<i>What's happening?!</i>

11:12.560 --> 11:14.680
An unusual level of defense...

11:14.680 --> 11:17.650
But it seems to be working really well.

11:17.650 --> 11:20.100
And they don't have anyone to bust it open.

11:20.100 --> 11:22.570
A second team is a second team...

11:30.050 --> 11:31.370
Oh, come on!

11:31.370 --> 11:32.670
I didn't hit him!

11:32.670 --> 11:33.300
Don't give me...

11:33.300 --> 11:33.920
Hey!

11:33.500 --> 11:35.400
Watch your mouth.

11:35.400 --> 11:38.340
Your play is getting rough 
because you're desperate.

11:38.340 --> 11:40.110
If you don't tone it down, 
I'll have to give you a card.

11:40.110 --> 11:40.720
Dammit!

11:42.470 --> 11:43.220
Hey.

11:43.220 --> 11:43.720
Hm?

11:44.010 --> 11:46.750
Have you no shame?

11:46.750 --> 11:48.700
Focusing so blatantly on the defense...

11:49.230 --> 11:50.770
There's no fun in it.

11:50.770 --> 11:52.600
Come on, bring it on.

11:53.640 --> 11:56.170
True, this is no fun.

11:56.170 --> 11:58.340
But everyone understands why it's necessary.

11:59.660 --> 12:03.990
We refuse to lose to you, the youth team!

12:05.490 --> 12:08.240
Esperion B

12:05.490 --> 12:08.240
Seikyo High

12:14.530 --> 12:16.190
What? You're weirding me out.

12:16.910 --> 12:23.090
Asari... You're... a master at overlapping!

12:23.430 --> 12:24.240
Huh?

12:24.240 --> 12:26.760
You're a defender, right?

12:26.760 --> 12:29.680
You just came back from 
the front of the goal.

12:30.110 --> 12:31.370
That's right.

12:31.730 --> 12:35.440
You are somehow always behind me!

12:37.440 --> 12:39.710
Hey, come back, you all!

12:41.310 --> 12:44.700
And... And Kuroda is...

12:46.200 --> 12:52.940
always positioning himself to 
be in between me and Asari...

12:53.550 --> 12:58.100
Don't tell me you were leisurely 
observing our teammates.

12:58.100 --> 12:59.840
We only have 30 minutes left.

13:00.130 --> 13:02.250
I noticed right away!

13:02.250 --> 13:06.090
As soon as I started paying attention, 
I could see what they were doing.

13:06.090 --> 13:11.970
I mean, you, Asari, and Kuroda are on 
the same line, so it's kinda obvious.

13:12.270 --> 13:14.750
No, that's not all!

13:15.340 --> 13:16.750
And even if it is...

13:21.650 --> 13:24.210
Hey, are you gonna be okay, Ashito?

13:25.240 --> 13:28.100
Ohtomo, Togashi...

13:28.100 --> 13:28.970
Huh?

13:30.040 --> 13:33.170
All this time, I've been thinking,

13:33.170 --> 13:37.540
"Why don't they get 
the play I'm trying to make?"

13:38.530 --> 13:42.450
"Why aren't they looking at me?" But...

13:43.180 --> 13:46.530
I didn't even see what was
right in front of my eyes.

13:48.050 --> 13:51.930
Maybe I was the one who 
wasn't looking at them?

13:52.820 --> 13:54.950
Let's switch them out, Nozomi-san.

13:55.740 --> 13:58.030
If we don't, it will affect 
their morale in the future.

13:58.610 --> 14:01.520
Aoi and Asari especially 
need to be called back.

14:03.110 --> 14:04.530
Five more minutes.

14:05.540 --> 14:07.530
Give me five more minutes to observe them.

14:08.230 --> 14:10.060
Asari, return it to the center!

14:10.060 --> 14:11.030
You'll be surrounded!

14:11.530 --> 14:12.530
Asari!

14:13.580 --> 14:19.670
<i>Asari, Kuroda, and I are at an 
equal distance most of the time.</i>

14:20.920 --> 14:25.530
<i>If I get the ball and run with 
it without even looking around,</i>

14:25.530 --> 14:28.440
<i>they try and catch up with me. That's why.</i>

14:29.300 --> 14:33.590
<i>I can't quite make sense 
of what that means yet.</i>

14:34.110 --> 14:37.810
<i>But Kuroda is over there right now.</i>

14:38.110 --> 14:43.820
<i>If I were in Asari's place, 
where would I want me to be?</i>

14:57.170 --> 14:59.830
<i>I-It went through!</i>

15:01.630 --> 15:03.070
Aoi! Go cover him!

15:06.250 --> 15:08.090
All right, a goal kick!

15:09.460 --> 15:11.180
Too bad, youth team!

15:11.180 --> 15:13.450
The ball finally went through 
for you, but no good!

15:13.450 --> 15:15.600
You got lucky, but it won't happen again!

15:23.770 --> 15:26.000
That was another mistake by Aoi.

15:26.000 --> 15:31.890
The ball went through nice and clean, 
but he just stood there and did nothing.

15:33.560 --> 15:35.620
Aoi's performance today is lackluster.

15:36.030 --> 15:37.780
It's been five minutes, Nozomi-san.

15:37.780 --> 15:38.620
Let's switch him out.

15:39.180 --> 15:41.690
It is <i>you</i> who are lackluster today.

15:42.580 --> 15:47.340
You're the one who always tells me to 
think and see outside of the theory.

15:47.990 --> 15:50.660
You're a hard-core Fukuda fanatic,

15:50.660 --> 15:54.140
but I guess you're rattled because
 our opponents have three goals on us?

15:57.000 --> 16:00.140
We have 30 minutes to go.

16:01.430 --> 16:05.400
I'm expecting to see 
something exciting today.

16:10.100 --> 16:13.410
<i>For a second, I got my hopes up for you again.</i>

16:15.310 --> 16:17.390
<i>Since the way you positioned 
yourself just now...</i>

16:17.390 --> 16:20.790
<i>and the one-touch pass 
to Kuroda were perfect!</i>

16:20.790 --> 16:24.490
<i>But seeing how you couldn't 
even go in to cover,</i>

16:24.490 --> 16:26.750
<i>you still don't understand anything!</i>

16:27.170 --> 16:36.060
<i>Esperion's soccer isn't so easy to keep up
 for a newbie who doesn't know anything...</i>

16:43.810 --> 16:45.060
Asari!

16:49.020 --> 16:51.130
For those three...

16:51.130 --> 16:52.070
Hm?

16:52.680 --> 16:54.570
The three players on the left wing...

16:57.990 --> 16:59.200
Oh, come on!

16:59.200 --> 17:02.450
Why are you three passing the 
ball back and forth between you?

17:02.450 --> 17:06.210
Are you trying to kill time when 
we're three points ahead of you?

17:06.210 --> 17:08.050
Oh, I see!

17:08.050 --> 17:11.110
Is one of those three your 
boyfriend, by any chance?

17:11.110 --> 17:14.120
I know! It's the cute one with blonde hair!

17:15.720 --> 17:17.720
I can't quite put it into words.

17:18.930 --> 17:23.220
<i>But all of a sudden, something 
shifted with those three.</i>

17:24.580 --> 17:25.990
<i>I'm sorry, Kuroda!</i>

17:25.990 --> 17:29.230
<i>Earlier, all I could think of 
was how Asari was feeling,</i>

17:29.230 --> 17:31.560
<i>and I didn't think of what you needed!</i>

17:32.230 --> 17:37.240
<i>Pass, and then immediately go to
 cover the receiver, am I right?</i>

17:41.940 --> 17:44.000
You're returning the ball to him again?

17:45.050 --> 17:48.500
<i>If I were Kuroda, where do I want me to be?</i>

17:50.880 --> 17:53.020
Ashito! The other side!

17:54.010 --> 17:56.380
Ashito! I'm behind you, give it to me!

17:56.650 --> 17:59.180
<i>I'm sorry, Tachibana, Togashi!</i>

17:59.180 --> 18:02.090
<i>Let me focus on the movements 
of Asari and Kuroda!</i>

18:02.090 --> 18:05.140
<i>Right now, I don't know why,</i>

18:05.140 --> 18:08.900
<i>but a voice in my head is telling 
me that it's what I have to do!</i>

18:11.870 --> 18:14.250
Oh, I see.

18:14.250 --> 18:18.010
Those three... They're looking 
each other in the eye.

18:19.220 --> 18:22.280
They're talking with their eyes right now.

18:24.450 --> 18:25.790
Go for a shot, Aoi!

18:26.010 --> 18:29.250
<i>I can do a middle-range shot... right now!</i>

18:45.560 --> 18:46.890
Well done!

18:47.790 --> 18:50.460
It was a perfect play to 
break them up, Aoi, Asari!

18:50.460 --> 18:51.810
One goal to start!

18:52.500 --> 18:53.840
Don't worry!

18:53.840 --> 18:55.780
We're still up by two goals!

18:55.780 --> 18:58.330
Let's defend for another 
15 minutes, and we'll win!

18:59.350 --> 19:00.520
<i>"Don't worry"?</i>

19:00.520 --> 19:02.100
<i>Is that really true?</i>

19:02.100 --> 19:04.970
<i>I had no idea what was happening.</i>

19:04.970 --> 19:10.100
<i>We have so many of us on defense, 
yet they perfectly broke us up.</i>

19:10.430 --> 19:12.330
<i>With only those three...</i>

19:12.780 --> 19:14.330
Come on, get back quickly!

19:16.210 --> 19:17.420
You had a shot.

19:18.690 --> 19:20.590
Why did you pass the ball to me?

19:21.940 --> 19:23.970
I want to know that myself.

19:31.560 --> 19:33.610
<i>That's right. I had a shot then.</i>

19:36.810 --> 19:40.990
<i>I did, but unconsciously, 
I passed the ball to Asari.</i>

19:40.990 --> 19:44.490
<i>Until now, I would have definitely 
gone for the shot myself.</i>

19:45.350 --> 19:49.370
<i>Because I don't want to compromise 
my pride as a forward.</i>

19:50.620 --> 19:53.050
<i>Then why did I...</i>

20:00.040 --> 20:01.380
<i>That's right.</i>

20:02.090 --> 20:06.640
Teach me how to play soccer!

20:07.780 --> 20:11.390
<i>You're here because you 
want to change, aren't you?</i>

20:12.250 --> 20:13.450
<i>I see!</i>

20:14.020 --> 20:18.020
<i>Right now, I'm learning how to play soccer!</i>

20:18.020 --> 20:19.280
Ashito!

20:20.020 --> 20:22.780
Watch out! They're coming in from the side!

20:28.120 --> 20:32.540
Like you said, something interesting 
is happening with those three.

20:33.290 --> 20:34.890
They're making eye contact,

20:35.340 --> 20:39.380
almost incessantly, 
to communicate with each other.

20:40.100 --> 20:43.010
In sports like soccer where 
situations can change in a second,

20:43.010 --> 20:46.650
you rarely have time to 
bark out instructions.

20:46.650 --> 20:48.930
In which case, the most 
effective method is...

20:49.300 --> 20:50.860
Eye contact.

20:51.430 --> 20:54.940
When Hans Ooft became general manager
 of the Japan National team,

20:54.940 --> 20:59.110
he ingrained that most basic of 
the basics into his players.

20:59.690 --> 21:03.770
And yet, even professional players 
haven't necessarily mastered it.

21:04.260 --> 21:06.840
Simply looking at each other's 
eyes won't work.

21:07.950 --> 21:11.390
There has to be a mutual understanding.

21:12.010 --> 21:16.710
In that sense, those three 
have an ideal relationship.

21:21.970 --> 21:24.720
<i>Asari, I need you to run in!</i>

21:26.720 --> 21:27.800
Okay!

21:28.410 --> 21:29.800
I won't let you!

21:35.190 --> 21:37.170
<i>Now I'm getting it.</i>

21:37.820 --> 21:42.570
<i>Three. This number is what really matters.</i>

21:42.860 --> 21:44.880
<i>It can't be one or two.</i>

21:44.880 --> 21:50.700
<i>Soccer is a sport where three 
people carry the ball forward!</i>

21:51.210 --> 21:53.970
But what's most intriguing is...

21:53.970 --> 21:56.460
What clicked for them so suddenly?

21:58.050 --> 22:00.710
Yeah! This is so exciting!

22:01.590 --> 22:03.090
To Kuroda!

22:05.340 --> 22:07.840
<i>No matter how tight the defense might be,</i>

22:07.840 --> 22:13.220
<i>when three people who share the same mind 
go at it, there's bound to be a gap!</i>

24:19.970 --> 24:30.250
