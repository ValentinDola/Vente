00:02.120 --> 00:08.980
One of Aoi Ashito's biggest weaknesses is
 how narrow the scope of his soccer is.

00:09.650 --> 00:11.860
He views it all at the individual level.

00:12.110 --> 00:14.550
"<i>I</i> will lead the team."

00:14.870 --> 00:17.150
"<i>I</i> will get all the good chances."

00:17.150 --> 00:20.430
It's always "I" this, or "I" that, or "I" the other.

00:21.510 --> 00:28.130
A classic example of a player unable to
 think beyond his own game. However...

00:28.890 --> 00:31.630
The fundamental shape 
in soccer is the triangle.

00:32.130 --> 00:34.790
It takes at least three 
players to do anything.

02:07.730 --> 02:12.730
What? Is he trying to buy 
time again because we scored?

02:13.090 --> 02:16.490
Hey, shit heel! Ya seriously 
wantin' me to snap your neck?!

02:25.320 --> 02:30.120
In the 11-on-21 game, 
you said something to us.

02:30.690 --> 02:32.750
"Let's focus on the basics."

02:35.370 --> 02:36.530
I did.

02:37.580 --> 02:41.760
In that training game, all we were
 doing was relying on numbers,

02:41.760 --> 02:44.010
so your words resonated with us.

02:44.790 --> 02:49.390
In actual fact, the point of the 
exercise wasn't about numbers.

02:49.390 --> 02:55.960
It was about whether we could play the game
 properly, whatever the number of players.

02:56.780 --> 03:00.200
And the fundamental shape
 in soccer is the triangle.

03:00.610 --> 03:04.360
That's been drilled into us
 since we were juniors.

03:04.910 --> 03:11.690
I see. So, back then, you were 
trying to create a triangle with me.

03:11.690 --> 03:12.580
However...

03:13.670 --> 03:18.770
You initiated the move, but you didn't
 understand the concept of the triangle.

03:19.580 --> 03:22.380
You didn't even look at us.

03:23.020 --> 03:25.420
And all because you wanted to score.

03:26.280 --> 03:27.210
Isn't that right?

03:29.080 --> 03:34.360
Since we were out of options, I signaled 
for you to send the ball out to the wing.

03:35.340 --> 03:37.780
But you passed it back to me instead.

03:38.700 --> 03:42.060
And my pass got intercepted
 and they countered.

03:42.870 --> 03:44.170
You could've told me...

03:44.170 --> 03:45.150
I did.

03:45.150 --> 03:46.080
Huh?

03:46.460 --> 03:47.670
I did tell you.

03:48.890 --> 03:54.220
We always talk about the importance of
 triangles in our daily training sessions.

03:54.920 --> 03:57.530
You must've heard it said plenty of times.

03:59.460 --> 04:05.010
Maybe you thought it was too simple and 
didn't think any more on it. Or just maybe...

04:05.780 --> 04:07.970
...you weren't interested to begin with.

04:09.320 --> 04:11.110
If so, we had no chance.

04:11.810 --> 04:17.980
Even if we'd laid it all out for you, 
I doubt it would've stuck.

04:20.970 --> 04:24.200
For us promoted players, 
who clawed our way up to get here,

04:24.200 --> 04:28.490
your attitude is impossible to understand, 
and frankly, we didn't want to.

04:29.530 --> 04:30.900
I'm pathetic.

04:32.140 --> 04:36.250
Teach me how to play soccer!

04:37.620 --> 04:41.460
I was prepared to learn the 
game from scratch, but...

04:41.460 --> 04:49.140
It didn't even occur to me to learn
 from you guys. From my teammates.

04:51.140 --> 04:57.270
In this youth team, in order to get better,
 I need to absorb everything I see.

04:59.900 --> 05:02.900
Thank you, Asari and Kuroda.

05:03.290 --> 05:06.530
Thank you for teaching me soccer.

05:10.350 --> 05:11.890
But how'd you do it?

05:13.800 --> 05:16.050
How'd you improve so quickly?

05:16.900 --> 05:19.190
Okay! The game's restarting.

05:19.190 --> 05:20.670
Listen up, you guys!

05:20.670 --> 05:25.810
Those three there! If we can contain 
those three, their team won't function.

05:26.430 --> 05:29.580
We have a one-goal lead! 
Let's protect it with our lives!

05:39.180 --> 05:40.190
<i>All this time,</i>

05:40.910 --> 05:47.450
<i>I thought soccer was about carrying 
the ball at your feet towards the goal.</i>

05:47.890 --> 05:49.320
<i>But that's not it at all.</i>

05:50.490 --> 05:54.330
<i>You and two other players 
nearby form a triangle.</i>

05:54.750 --> 05:58.580
<i>So how do we slide this triangle into
 the opposition's part of the field?</i>

05:59.580 --> 06:06.090
<i>We tempt the other team towards us, 
and that creates a space. A tiny gap.</i>

06:07.810 --> 06:10.520
<i>One tip of the triangle
 sneaks into that gap.</i>

06:10.520 --> 06:17.100
<i>To put pressure on us and fill the space,
 other players come across to cover.</i>

06:18.600 --> 06:22.190
<i>Next, you pass the ball around the 
triangle to move the other team.</i>

06:22.750 --> 06:24.900
<i>The tiny gaps start to accumulate...</i>

06:25.380 --> 06:27.740
<i>And create a big space
in the opposition's half!</i>

06:29.610 --> 06:31.120
Dammit!

06:31.120 --> 06:34.720
<i>A-Amazing. This is amazing!</i>

06:34.720 --> 06:38.870
<i>If we keep this up, 
how many goals can we score?</i>

06:49.910 --> 06:53.530
<i>What... What is this?</i>

07:05.730 --> 07:07.440
Don't lose your man!

07:09.770 --> 07:10.700
Asari!

07:32.370 --> 07:34.380
Ah, I knew it.

07:35.420 --> 07:39.930
Everyone moved the way 
I envisioned they would.

07:45.460 --> 07:46.940
Esperion B

07:45.460 --> 07:46.940
Seikyo High

08:01.340 --> 08:04.580
He rebuilt the triangle.

08:04.580 --> 08:06.700
Anri? Yuma?

08:07.720 --> 08:13.830
He replaced Kuroda with Ohtomo
 as one tip of the triangle.

08:13.830 --> 08:16.470
Yup. It sure was somethin'.

08:18.340 --> 08:19.390
Ashito.

08:23.080 --> 08:27.900
That was weird. I... feel weird.

08:29.070 --> 08:37.160
It's like... I could see what they would all...
everyone on our team and theirs...

08:40.940 --> 08:45.620
I could see... what they would all do next.

08:48.630 --> 08:52.060
Ashito did great with that goal just now.

08:52.930 --> 08:55.710
But it was Asari and Ohtomo 
who combined to score.

08:56.890 --> 09:02.230
Aoi made a dummy run from
 left to right across the area,

09:02.230 --> 09:05.270
as if the final pass from
 Asari was going to him.

09:06.450 --> 09:11.280
Seikyo High was wariest of 
the three on the left wing,

09:11.280 --> 09:14.440
so they sent two players
 across to challenge him.

09:14.800 --> 09:24.790
Ashito

09:15.510 --> 09:17.220
But that was his plan.

09:16.800 --> 09:24.790
Move 
this guy

09:17.690 --> 09:22.970
He lured those players towards him
 to clear a path for Ohtomo's shot.

09:18.800 --> 09:24.790
Ohtomo

09:24.070 --> 09:29.790
On top of that, in order to draw 
Asari's attention to Ohtomo,

09:30.210 --> 09:35.800
he guided Asari's eyes to
 Ohtomo as he ran past him.

09:36.670 --> 09:39.680
It was subtle, but he pointed to him.

09:41.080 --> 09:44.930
It's true. That boy controlled everything.

09:45.450 --> 09:50.330
Just in this match alone, he's not only 
grasped the concept of triangles in soccer,

09:50.330 --> 09:52.280
he's built on it.

09:53.550 --> 09:57.450
But how is that even possible?

10:04.760 --> 10:07.710
We're in extra time! Last three minutes!

10:08.040 --> 10:11.340
Wrench 'em open! Score one
 more goal and we win!

10:11.340 --> 10:16.090
Protect the goal! Even if we have to rough 
'em up, we gotta keep the score tied!

10:21.460 --> 10:25.350
When they started squabblin' 
the day of the entrance ceremony,

10:25.610 --> 10:29.100
Ashito drew somethin' 
strange on the blackboard.

10:29.690 --> 10:33.900
Only those who noticed 
stayed behind after.

10:33.900 --> 10:37.400
<b>Akutsu</b>

10:33.900 --> 10:37.400
<b>Pass</b>

10:33.900 --> 10:37.400
<b>Me</b>

10:33.900 --> 10:37.400
<b>Me</b>

10:33.900 --> 10:37.400
<b>Tachibana</b>

10:33.900 --> 10:37.400
<b>Kuroda</b>

10:33.900 --> 10:37.400

10:33.900 --> 10:37.400
<b>Roan</b>

10:33.900 --> 10:37.400
<b>Taira-san</b>

10:34.360 --> 10:37.400
Hey, this ain't accurate, is it?

10:38.930 --> 10:41.910
The placement of the players 
around me is correct, though.

10:42.450 --> 10:44.790
Same with the ones around me.

10:44.790 --> 10:48.160
That's a bit of a leap, don't you think?

10:48.160 --> 10:52.670
Surely no one can perfectly memorize the
 placement of <i>every</i> player on the field...

10:52.670 --> 10:55.010
You're right. It's crazy talk.

10:55.780 --> 10:57.940
But I've been thinkin'...

10:58.270 --> 11:02.050
The speed of Ashito's progress is no joke.

11:03.780 --> 11:09.600
His basics are laughable, but once he 
gets somethin' down, he owns that skill.

11:09.600 --> 11:11.690
He's able to put it to use, I mean.

11:11.960 --> 11:17.820
No one masters a technique that fast. 
Seems like he has some kind of...

11:18.120 --> 11:20.700
...extraordinary instinctual ability.

11:21.240 --> 11:28.450
Aoi is most likely able to predict 
how players are going to move.

11:29.430 --> 11:31.710
And the sheer scale of it...

11:35.480 --> 11:38.780
Memorizing the placement 
of the players on the field?

11:38.780 --> 11:43.330
And now, he's "predicting" how 
they'll move? Every single player?

11:43.330 --> 11:50.250
You're a youth player, right? Don't bring 
such illogical fantasies into soccer, 'kay?

11:50.250 --> 11:50.990
Nope!

11:52.540 --> 11:54.660
Is it illogical, though?

11:57.000 --> 12:00.030
Well, anyway, all that
 difficult stuff aside,

12:00.490 --> 12:06.370
I've been excited 'bout Ashito 
ever since I saw him at the tryouts.

12:15.610 --> 12:17.260
<i>We're almost out of time.</i>

12:19.470 --> 12:23.260
<i>But my brain isn't working anymore.</i>

12:27.940 --> 12:28.890
Throw-in!

12:29.190 --> 12:30.140
Ashito!

12:30.630 --> 12:31.990
Take it quickly!

12:34.070 --> 12:39.520
<i>'Cause I'm seeing all this weird stuff, 
my head's getting fuzzy...</i>

12:41.940 --> 12:44.030
Oh, excuse me. The ball.

13:04.280 --> 13:05.940
Ah, dammit!

13:05.940 --> 13:11.010
They're bringing on subs to eat up as much time 
as they can. They're totally going for the draw.

13:11.010 --> 13:13.100
Just make the substitution already, you—

13:14.770 --> 13:18.030
<i>There's no time left. 
Maybe just enough for one more play.</i>

13:19.220 --> 13:20.060
You...

13:22.900 --> 13:24.850
You need to calm down.

13:29.540 --> 13:30.790
I'm...

13:31.530 --> 13:32.390
I'm sorry.

13:43.070 --> 13:45.180
I'll score a goal for you.

13:48.750 --> 13:53.060
Aoi! I'll take the throw-in. 
I need you up front. Go up front.

13:57.030 --> 13:59.870
<i>Triangles. Eye contact.</i>

14:00.810 --> 14:04.280
<i>I learned a different side 
to soccer, and it's awesome.</i>

14:05.270 --> 14:09.030
<i>Use the players around you, 
and let the team score.</i>

14:09.630 --> 14:11.780
<i>But that's just where it starts.</i>

14:12.110 --> 14:13.730
<i>I'm going to score.</i>

14:15.150 --> 14:17.890
<i>I'll take it one step further and use my head.</i>

14:26.050 --> 14:27.800
Everyone on offense!

14:33.310 --> 14:35.580
Don't look so anxious! Defend the goal!

14:35.580 --> 14:37.810
<i>Defend the goal? But how?</i>

14:37.810 --> 14:40.310
<i>Do we stick more players on those three?</i>

14:40.650 --> 14:43.060
<i>But we tried that already!</i>

14:43.060 --> 14:46.500
<i>We ended up leaving that 
midfielder unmarked and he scored.</i>

14:46.500 --> 14:50.820
<i>Which means they can coordinate 
a move with any player on the field!</i>

14:50.840 --> 14:54.650
<i>Who do we pick up?
 Who are we supposed to mark?</i>

14:55.080 --> 14:56.580
I'm coming for you!

14:58.080 --> 15:02.450
<i>He's the one who started this. His play 
suddenly changed and everything went south!</i>

15:02.450 --> 15:06.350
<i>We should have taken him out sooner!</i>

15:06.840 --> 15:08.110
Asari!

15:08.970 --> 15:09.950
Play on!

15:10.590 --> 15:12.380
Don't get drawn out! Stay back!

15:13.460 --> 15:17.420
Their tactic is to draw you out, 
so stay put in front of the goal!

15:21.010 --> 15:24.980
All I need to do... is bring myself.

15:26.840 --> 15:30.230
All I need to do is bring myself.

15:32.810 --> 15:35.990
Today was... so much fun.

15:55.270 --> 15:57.170
<i>The right side's totally open.</i>

15:57.170 --> 15:58.430
<i>Yes, it is.</i>

15:59.450 --> 16:02.260
<i>How come no one's going over there?</i>

16:02.810 --> 16:06.530
<i>It's clear to us because 
we're seeing it from above.</i>

16:06.530 --> 16:09.400
<i>The view at ground level is very limited.</i>

16:09.810 --> 16:13.410
<i>So don't be mad at the players.</i>

16:13.980 --> 16:19.760
<i>Isn't it like a dream, being able to see and 
know where the players are from above,</i>

16:20.120 --> 16:23.770
<i>as if you're a bird in flight,
 circling over the field?</i>

16:24.300 --> 16:25.770
<i>But it's </i>not<i> a dream.</i>

16:26.180 --> 16:32.820
<i>It's rare, but there are players in 
the world who can do precisely that.</i>

16:48.770 --> 16:49.770
Esperion B

16:48.770 --> 16:49.770
Seikyo High

16:55.480 --> 16:57.160
Nice one!

17:06.230 --> 17:09.090
He is indeed interesting.

17:09.090 --> 17:10.420
Isn't he just?

17:10.860 --> 17:15.670
Akutsu never talks about other players, 
but he mentioned this guy, so I was intrigued.

17:16.430 --> 17:18.430

The most interesting part is he seems 
to have no idea about his abilities.

17:24.500 --> 17:29.070
Seikyo High was pathetic. Too wary 
and obsessed with defending deep.

17:29.070 --> 17:32.440
They didn't address the space that
 opened up for mid-range shots.

17:33.080 --> 17:37.250
But no one could've guessed how much 
they'd up their game in the second half.

17:37.780 --> 17:38.950
Quite a feat.

17:39.910 --> 17:41.320
Well, this is rare.

Okay, all of you! Eat up!

18:23.540 --> 18:25.120
Wow!

18:25.120 --> 18:28.040
I-I-It's so <i>tender!</i>

18:28.490 --> 18:32.140
The moment you bite into it, it just melts!

18:32.140 --> 18:35.460
And at the same time, the juices spread—

18:35.170 --> 18:39.430
<b>All-You-Can-Eat\h<i>!!</i></b>

18:35.460 --> 18:36.960
Just shut up and eat!

18:36.960 --> 18:38.430
That's all wrong!

18:39.430 --> 18:41.930
What's all wrong, Hana?

18:42.190 --> 18:45.560
Grilling can make or break meat!
 Korean BBQ ribs have lots of fat.

18:45.560 --> 18:48.430
Grill it right so it tastes better, 
and is gentler on your stomach!

18:48.430 --> 18:50.690
Wh-What did you say?!

18:50.960 --> 18:54.040
The so-called "8:2 rule." Grill one side
 about 80%, the other about 20%.

18:54.940 --> 18:57.190
It gives it a nice, crisp texture.

19:07.060 --> 19:10.170
Oh, uh... Sorry. Go ahead and enjoy.

19:10.750 --> 19:12.430
I'm an outsider here.

19:12.430 --> 19:16.840
Nah, you're the manager's sister, 
so you're far from being an outsider.

19:17.330 --> 19:19.950
Kuroda, you know Hana?

19:19.950 --> 19:24.320
She's been helping us out since 
we were on the junior youth team.

19:24.320 --> 19:27.770
We're in the same grade, so the 
promoted players all know her.

19:30.520 --> 19:34.900
Oh, is that so? Then you should come 
watch more of our games, Hana.

19:37.770 --> 19:39.900
We'll win next time, too!

19:47.000 --> 19:50.980
Anyway, Asari, you wanted to say 
something to Aoi and the others, right?

19:54.450 --> 19:55.190
The...

19:58.500 --> 20:03.290
The day of the opening ceremony... 
I might have... m-might have gone...

20:06.860 --> 20:10.180
...too far. Please forget what I said.

20:10.180 --> 20:12.700
Hm? Oh!

20:15.640 --> 20:18.010
I wasn't there, but...

20:19.480 --> 20:25.030
We grow by having heart-to-hearts like 
that one! It's how we build our friendship!

20:27.310 --> 20:30.040
Today's a new day, 
so let's work hard together!

20:33.040 --> 20:35.290
Ohtomo, you too.

20:36.230 --> 20:38.820
Let's play soccer!

20:41.010 --> 20:43.170
But, you know, Aoi-kun...

20:44.200 --> 20:49.930
When we had that fight, there was 
something you said that spoke to me.

20:50.190 --> 20:52.330
Stop obsessing over being the one to score?

20:52.330 --> 20:55.690
The moment a forward starts 
thinking like that, he's done!

20:55.940 --> 20:57.430
I liked that.

20:58.500 --> 21:04.700
Maybe those of us promoted from junior youth
do think about soccer based only on theory.

21:05.080 --> 21:09.090
But you're not bound by theories. 
I think I can learn a lot from you.

21:09.580 --> 21:10.930
Kuroda.

21:11.550 --> 21:13.980
Wh-Whoa! Kuribayashi?!

21:15.070 --> 21:17.030
